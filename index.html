            <p>
                Currently I'm working as a backend developer. My primary development language is Python.
                I do use Emacs/Arch Linux/Tiling WM workflow. Some configs for this could be found in my
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Randomneo/confs">confs</a> repository.
            </p>

                Where I'm skilled at?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Python:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Django (DRF),
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flask,
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SQLAlchemy
                    </li>

            </p>
            <p>
                I could write code in:
                <ul>

                        Python

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lua
                    </li>

                Have experience with GCloud, AWS, DigitalOcean. And could do some DevOps staff
                (with help of all might google.com).

                Adept of good code quality (what can't be said about my GitHub)), currently
                working on improving it) if you'll ask me where I want to spend time to write some
                feature or improve flow of development I would choose second one.

                Hobbies and where my "free" time goes
            </h2>
            <p>
                I do like Lisp programming languages (could spend hours configuring Emacs or
                looking how to solve problem using elisp). I also can play some music on piano,
                guitar or flute.

                I'm a big fan of Japan and Japanese culture. It started with anime, but now
                you could say I'm Japanese maniac)) Japanese language, culture, literally
                anything that made in Japan. Despite that I'm currently at the begging of
                learning Japanese (I would rate my knowledge as beginner).
            </p>
            <p>
                Cars one more place where my time goes. Culture of drifting overflowed me.
                I'm very eager when it comes to drift (on Japanese cars in particular).

                Games. I have used to play Dota 2 (and may be I can play it from time to time),
                as you can guess by now I like Japanese single player games I can't say I like them
                all. Also when it comes to contesting games, I can get engaged with it a lot (It could
                be any game: chess, go, Dota 2).
